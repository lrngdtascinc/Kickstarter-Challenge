# Kickstarter-Challenge
## Using Kickstarter Data to Help Visualize and Understand How Certain Campaigns Compared to Others.

## Project Overview

   My client Louise decided to launch a fundraising campaign of her own, and quickly saw amazing results. This made Louise curious, so she decided that she wants to know how other fundraising campaigns in her field fared to her own. My job was to sift through the data and organize it in a way that would compare kickstarters based on their launch date, and their fundraising goals.   

## Analysis and Challenges

   Our Goals for this project were first, to see what were the outcomes of kickstarters specifically in the "Theater" parent category based on the dates they were launched, and second, to see what were the outcomes of kickstarters specifically in the "Play" subcategory based on their fundraising goals. What I quickly realized is that kickstarters that were associated with the "Theater" parent category saw a significant increase in meeting their fundraising goals around the middle of April into May, so around the end of the spring season coming into the summer months. But as we move through the summer months, we unfortuntely see a slow and progressive drop off of kickstarters hitting their goals, followed by a small rally starting in September, peaking in October, and dropping off again going into November, as seen in the chart bellow.
