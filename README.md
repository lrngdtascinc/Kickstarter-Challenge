# Kickstarter-Challenge
## Using Kickstarter Data to Help Visualize and Understand How Certain Campaigns Compared to Others.

## Project Overview

   My client Louise decided to launch a fundraising campaign of her own, and quickly saw amazing results. This made Louise curious, so she decided that she wants to know how other fundraising campaigns in her field fared to her own. My job was to sift through the data and organize it in a way that would compare kickstarters based on their launch date, and their fundraising goals.   

## Analysis and Challenges
#### Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date
   Our Goals for this project were first, to see what were the outcomes of kickstarters specifically in the "Theater" parent category based on the dates they were launched, and second, to see what were the outcomes of kickstarters specifically in the "Play" subcategory based on their fundraising goals. What I quickly realized is that kickstarters that were associated with the "Theater" parent category saw a significant increase in meeting their fundraising goals around the middle of April into May, so around the end of the spring season coming into the summer months. But as we move through the summer months, we unfortuntely see a slow and progressive drop off of kickstarters hitting their goals, followed by a small rally starting in September, peaking in October, and dropping off again going into November, as seen in the chart below.

#### Play Outcomes Based on Goal 
The second analysis was done on the data based on the subcategory "Plays" to find out if there were any correlations between the goal for the kickstarter and the actual success of said kickstarter. What we saw here was a stronger success rate with lower fundraising goals, and a lower success rate with higher fundraising goals, as seen in the chart below.

#### Challenges
   One of the cahellenges I had specifically was overlooking and selecting the wrong cell ranges when using the "=COUNTIF" function to organize the successful, failed, and canceled fundraising campaigns by goal amount. It took me about an hour to realize this mistake, but once I caught it I was able to fix it relatively quickly. Another challenge I can see some people having when trying to organize the data, is remembering to manage your filters properly. I did remember to clear my filters when starting a new visualization but I can see how one might forget and start to stack filters.
   
## Results

#### Conclusions
   What I've gathered on Theater kickstarters based on Launch dates is that people tend to be more generous around the beginning of the year, more specifically, around the middle of the month of April towards the beginning of May, which might be due to tax returns. We can also see a second rally around the holiday seasons, peaking in October and dropping off as November, and December approach. Leading me to think that due to the increase of holiday spending, people tend to be more frugal, especially when it comes to funding kickstarters for theater productions. If we look at the Outcomes Based on Goals chart, we can see a negative correlation between the amount success a fundraising campaign can see the more money it asks for, showing me that if a fundraising campaign has a larger, more ambitious fundraising goal, the harder it is to reach that larger number to begin with, and the less likely people are willing to contribute to the kickstarter. I would recommend creating a chart where you can see a campaigns outcome, along with its goal, and how many contributers it had. Overall the insights from this project show that if you are looking to have a successful fundraising campaign, you should aim to start it around spring and keep your budget as realistic and minimal as possible to ensure success.
